# Econophysics_Wellness_Distribution
This is a simulation of wellness within agents of a system based on money distribution. The code even includes a taxed economic model where at periodic intervals, money is equaly distributed among all agents :) 

It follows from the statistical mechanics developed by Botzman, Maxwell and other titans that inequality is an emergent property of systems such as the economy :( 

Enjoy the model coded by Izael Rascon and myself.
